At times we have all failed. There are many reasons why you may feel like a failure or that you will never be a success. These are some of the reasons you might recognize for your own failures: <br><ol><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Procrastination</b> <br>It's normal to procrastinate a little, but often we put off doing difficult or unpleasant tasks that we have to do and end up sabotaging ourselves. Procrastination is the number one thing to fix if you want to be successful. Your mindset will suffer when you procrastinate because you're not thinking about being productive or about moving towards your goals; in fact you're doing the opposite by avoiding that.&nbsp;<br><br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Fear <br></b>Fear of failure and fear of success can both stop you from achieving high-level success. Success means change, setting new goals, and a defined line between before and after. This fear is what prevents your mind from being in the right mindset for success. Sometimes we're even guilty of sabotaging ourselves (through procrastination or other means) so that we “prove” our fears right by not being successful. <br><br>A fear mindset is one where everything is seen as too risky or too dangerous which means you'll never move forwards. Conquering the fear mindset is the hardest thing for many people who are not naturally optimistic or courageous.&nbsp;<br><br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Being Unrealistic </b><br>Part of dreaming about being successful is that it hasn't happened yet. When we imagine things it can be both good or bad. Those dreams can drive us to achieve further or they can always be just out of reach so we eventually give up because we never achieve them. <br><br>Setting the right goals and being able to motivate yourself is important in being successful because if you set unrealistic goals you'll always feel like a failure. There's a very good analogy about teaching fish to climb trees which illustrates this. If you think you're always a failure then maybe it's because you're setting the wrong goals.&nbsp;<br><br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Being unsure of your path </b><br>Part of success is knowing where you're going. You might have a vision of where you want to be but no real understanding of how to get there. Without having an idea of your route you may freeze up, instead choosing to stay in a “safe” and known place rather than risk the change that may come with success or the shame of taking yourself down a failed pathway.</font><br></li></ol>If you're not sure about the next step are you sure you've even taken one? Many people struggle to even start their journey or get bogged down without realizing how close to the finish they are. Imagine you were chipping away at a wall, you've been chipping forever and don't feel like you will ever make it through so you quit. What you didn't know is that with only 5 more chips you would have made it. How sad. <br><br>If you want to be successful then you need a success mindset and you have to tackle these behaviours and more if you want that to happen. Change can be difficult, it can be hard, but by changing these behaviours using these simple ways you can start cultivating the right mindset to be successful.</span></span></font></div>
