Why? <br><br>Why do you want to be successful? Many times our reason why, the thing that drives us, can make all the difference between actually achieving success or simply struggling towards it. <br><br>Procrastination is a sign that you've forgotten the “why” behind whatever you're trying to achieve. Here's a good analogy: You want to have clean clothes but you hate doing laundry. You can choose to have someone else do it, or simply wear the dirty clothes, however, you have to pay the other person. <br><br>If success is clean clothes that don't cost you money you may put it off because you hate doing laundry but eventually, a decision will have to be made, by which time you now have to do three times the amount of laundry making the task even more unpleasant. You have a job interview tomorrow and must have a clean shirt. By procrastinating about your hatred for laundry you've made the problem worse and you're no closer to success. <br><br>You didn't want the clean clothes enough but now because of that interview, you have no choice. Your drive to have clean clothes has become important because you really want that job. Your reason for doing laundry has become something more important, so you do it. <br><br>Harnessing that “why”, that drive to do things because you need to has a lot to do with the mindset of success. If you see your goals and successes as necessary, even ones you don't really want to do then you won't have much drive to do them. Tackle each situation by reminding yourself why you're doing it. <br><br><b style=""><font color="#003067">How</font></b> <br><br>Lost of people need motivation. Use posters, notes, give yourself rewards but make your reason what drives you to keep going on that path to success. Boost your motivation by having friends and family hold you accountable and check in on how you're doing. Ask them to push you and make sure you're staying on track. <br><br><b style=""><font color="#003067">S.M.A.R.T Goals </font></b><br><br>There are many different acronyms for SMART. What it boils down to is being able to make goals that help you become successful rather than those which promote failure. <br></font><ul style=""><li style=""><font face="Arial, sans-serif" style="" size="3"><b>S</b> – Specific, Successful,&nbsp;<br></font></li><li style=""><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>M</b> – Measurable, Mindful, Masterable,<br></font></li><li style=""><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A</b> – Achievable, Acceptable, Approachable, Authentic&nbsp;<br></font></li><li style=""><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>R</b> – Realistic, Right,&nbsp;<br></font></li><li style=""><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><b>T</b> – Timed, Truthful,&nbsp;<br></font></li></ul><font size="3"><b><u>Specific</u></b> goals are ones that are defined. A specific goal is to make $5000 a week by the time you're 30. Goals that are specific have a defined line between achievement/success and failure. By making a goal specific it's easier to determine a path. “Success” is not a goal because it is not definable. <br><br><b><u>Measurable</u></b> goals are ones that not only have an end goal but ones that you can set milestones to reach. For example, if your goal is to own a house then one of the goals along the way may be to pay down credit card debt to afford the down payment and another may be to stick to a grocery budget to save money for the same. <br><br>Those in between goals are just as important as the final goal because it shows us that we are able to succeed at each step. This teaches us not to be afraid of success and that what comes after success, even when it is small, isn't so scary. <br><br><b><u>Achievable </u></b>goals&nbsp;sound simple but the fact is many of us set goals we won't ever achieve. The reason for this is either that we set unreasonable targets which will inevitably end in failure, something that then “proves” our doubts and fears correct. Achievable goals are those which fit all other SMART targets and may only be stepping stones towards bigger goals. <br><br>A goal should also be authentic, meaning that it comes from your actual desire to succeed and helps you on that path rather than one that is frivolous or distracting from your end goal. <br><br><b><u>Realistic</u></b> goals are those which you are likely to achieve. This is different from achievable because sometimes it is possible to achieve the impossible. A realistic goal would be to lose 100lb in a year, an unrealistic goal would be to lose it in a month. <br><br>While both goals are achievable the amount of time given for that achievement is what separates them from realistic and unrealistic. In other words, don't be too hard on yourself with your deadlines but make them realistic enough that you're pushed to achieve them. <br><br><b><u>Timed </u></b>goals set a timeline for the goal to be achieved. A goal that does not have a timeline is likely to lead to procrastination because there's no urgency. Too strict of a deadline can create stress and will likely lead to an unachievable or unrealistic goal. A truthful goal is another way of saying “authentic” meaning it keeps you on the right path.</font></span></span></font></div>
