When we hear good things it makes us smile and it's part of our evolution that we are programmed to repeat good things and keep doing them. If you burn your hand on the stove because it's hot you learn that touching a hot stove hurts and so you don't do it again. When you speak to or about yourself in a negative manner you should feel the same way yet most of us are guilty of talking to ourselves in a way we should be ashamed of. <br><br>A positive self-talk is a powerful tool for having a successful mindset. When you use positive reinforcement your brain helps to give you a “can do” attitude. <br><br>When you are negative you're actively reinforcing negative ideas and thoughts. In a way, being negative actually helps convince your brain you're going to fail by giving it the “proof” it needs through self sabotage. Optimism has been shown in research studies to actually help you live longer. <br><br>If you're optimistic it's likely you're happy. Happy people tend to be clearer about their goals and look for the good in every situation, even when things go wrong. <br><br><b><font color="#003067">How To Make Your Mind Positive </font></b><br><br>Being positive is actually something you can fake. The more you choose to be positive, even if it feels fake, the more often your mind will start to naturally choose positivity. By resolving to be a happier and more positive person who looks for the good you will always be able to see a different side. This can really help your journey to success when it comes to those obstacles. <br><br>The difficulty happens when you reach one of them. If you're struggling to see a positive side try motivating yourself with some inspirational quotes or take a break and come back to it later. Sometimes when you've focused on a problem for too long it makes it more difficult to see anything. <br><br>By reducing the amount of negativity you're likely to see a lot of personal growth and many positive changes in your life. You may find you're meeting new people and making friends, or that new opportunities come around more often because people are more inclined towards you. No one likes a negative person so when given the choice of who they want to work with your positivity will give you an edge. <br><br>There are many ways to practice being positive. Spending time with positive people has been shown to influence your own thinking positively while practising relaxation techniques like yoga also helps ease your mindset and make room for positive thinking. Some people can practice by solving problems for other people. By helping others it often puts our own problems into perspective and you may realize how lucky you are. <br><br><b><font color="#003067">Backed by Science </font></b><br><br>Positive thinking has been extensively researched, to the point that it has become widely accepted in the scientific community. This proves that many things are just mind over matter. Negative thinkers often have more health problems and depression. The first study into positive thinking used students with depression and had them try and use positive thinking instead. <br><br>Researchers found that negative thoughts made the depression worse but that positive thoughts helped to distract the mind and help students control their feelings better. In the 1950s women with depression were given “smile” masks with the intent that if they could see themselves smiling they would be more likely to want to smile themselves. While it may have looked ridiculous and was misguided this was part of what started science looking into positivity. <br><br>Another study worked on how negative thoughts change the brain. Yes, negative thoughts can actually change how your brain works. In 2006 a study found that people who were told to “worry” about the task at hand performed poorer than those who were told to “relax”. Negative thoughts actually harmed their ability to do simple tasks. This is especially important if you want to have a success mindset because you need to be able to use those brain cells! <br><br><b><font color="#003067">Benefits of Positive Thinking </font></b><br><ul><li>I<font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">mprove heart health&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Lower Stress&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Improve Immunity&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Longer Lifespan&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Prevents High Blood Pressure&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Improves Pain Tolerance&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Enjoy Life More&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Deal Better with Problems&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Boost Self-Esteem&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Form Better Relationships</font><br></li></ul></span></span></font></div>
