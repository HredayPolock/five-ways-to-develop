While you may not be waging a battle, much of his advice can be applied to life situations. One of his most powerful pieces was to see failures as a form of success. <br><br><b><font color="#003067">Step 1: Learn From Your Mistakes </font></b><br><br>When it comes to your mindset for success, you are on a journey. You may never achieve it but you're moving ever forwards on that journey by trying, and who knows, maybe success is just around the corner. But what happens then? If you succeed you'll have to pick a new journey or you'll be stagnating which means failure. It's possible for success to actually be failure! <br><br>If you're not seeing success as something fluid rather than a defined endpoint then you will always be a failure. Each “success” is really just a goal or stepping stone on the way to the next one. Success is a journey or a path. Each time you go along that path you may fail. If failure on that path is the worst thing that happens then it's not so bad. <br><br>If you fail you have succeeded in finding the wrong path. You now know not to try that again because you will fail. Think of a pathway with three possible directions. If you have chosen one and found it to be a failure that only leaves 2 more. You now have a 50:50 chance of being successful if you pick the right one. By failure you have become more educated on your journey and more likely to succeed. <br><br><b><font color="#003067">Step 2: Keep Going </font></b><br><br>Success is the journey. This is one of the most common mistakes people make, they think that by succeeding they will have finished when instead they should be continuing onward to their next one. This is part of the reason we are afraid of success itself and not the smaller goals along the way, we know they're not going to create a big change so we aren't so afraid of achieving them. By seeing each success not as a big achievement but as a stepping stone on a never-ending path we are more likely to achieve goals and be less scared of them. <br><br>Part of the success mindset is to always keep going, even when you think you've finished. This doesn't mean continuing to scrape an empty plate or walk into a wall because there's nowhere else to go. It means that if your idea of success is to make $5000 a week then when you achieve that you should aim for $10000 after. Keep going.</span></span></font></div>
